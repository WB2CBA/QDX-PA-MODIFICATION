# QDX-PA-MODIFICATION

QDX is a HF Digital Modes Transceiver produced as a kit by QRP LABS. 
Here is the link for QDX:

I designed a pcb adapter to be soldered on QDX transceiver PCB instead of BS170 mosfets to convert Mosfet PA to FDT86256 PA mosfets.

This Github repository contains all the information needed to carry out this PA modification.

Enjoy!
